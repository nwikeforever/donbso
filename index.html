  <div data-role="content">
    <p align="justify">The  Diocesan  Bible  study outline has continued to create positive impact in the life of our  members. For the past four years this study guide dealt extensively on the  importance of mission and evangelism. Members have been prepared on the need to  make witnessing for Christ their first priority. However, this mandate of  sometimes is hampered by the circumstances which may not be solved by human  wisdom alone.<br>
      It is an attempt to offer possible solutions and to alert  our parishioners and other Christians on the realities of life that this study  concentrates on the theme &ldquo;New Born&rdquo;. Today false life  abound in our society. Some people erroneously display religious arrogance. Some  find it difficult to tell themselves the truth about what life demands. This life  is full of challenges. Storms of life sometimes occur in the life of the  believer. When this occurs, what will the child of God do? As Christians, we should  not jettison out faith over board when difficulties come our ways. Therefore,  we should be equipped to call on our Lord Jesus Christ always to arrest every  storm that will confront us.</p>
    <p align="justify">When things get tough we should be more fervent in prayer so  that our boat will not be destroyed by the storm.<br>
      Its is my sincere prayer that as you make use of this  outline, you will discover the necessary tools with which to paddle your canoe  through the storms of life. Jesus Christ who calms every storms of life will  always assist us to succeed in all our endeavours if we remain faithful to Him.  </p>

    AIM: TO TEACH THAT THERE IS NEED FOR SPIRITUAL RENEWAL IN THE NEW YEAR.</strong></p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><br>
      The end of an era ushers in the beginning of  another. As year succeeds year, December 31st (end of a year) ushers in January  1st (Beginning of a new year). New year offers well meaning people the  opportunity to start afresh. Some make new year resolutions to turn new leaves,  change their patterns, adopt new life style, etc.<br>
    Again, the birth of Jesus Christ ushers in a new  dispensation of life which pushes the old life away and creates the new. As we  celebrate His birth and enjoy the new year, it has to be done with a change of  heart.</p>
    <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion </strong><em><br />(Tap on any question or segment with bible reference to open the bible verse)</em><br />1.  Share  your new year resolutions with others and say how  you plan to succeed.<br>

      <p align="justify">The  incarnation of Christ is the manifestation of the eternal word of God through  which all creation derives their life and light. He came to the depraved world  but due to blindness and ignorance, the world neither recognised nor received  Him. In a kind of epiphany, John presented Christ as the true life and light of  man who came to dispel darkness and illuminate human life and reason. He is the  origin and substance of life. All people owe their life and whatever light  (light of reason, conscience, natural, etc)  they have to Him.</p>

          TOPIC: THE HERALD OF THE ANGEL.<br />
          AIM: TO ENCOURAGE US TO RECEIVE THE GOOD NEWS WITH JOY AND DISSEMINATE IT WITH URGENCY</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong></p>
      <p align="justify">The birth of Jesus Christ was first declared by God  to the shepherds rather than the Kings and leaders of Israel through the Angel  and not through  men. That stated the  fact that something unique has happened. Accordingly, it was termed a gospel of  good news and great joy to the world.<br>
      It also attracted Angelic band of heavenly choir  who ascribed praises of glory to God and peace to the world. The shepherds were  then prompted to action of searching for the baby until they found him and they  made known what they have heard and seen to the people of their day.      </p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong><em><br />
      </em>
        <p>1. Does  God still communicate with people through Angels today? Give your reasons.<br>
          2. Mention  other four authentic ways through which God passes  information to the people in our own time (Heb 1:22,              2  Tim 3:16-17, 1 sam 3:4,6,8,10; Gen 28:10f).<br>
          3. Why  is the birth of Jesus Christ a good news of great joy to the world? (Isa 9:2-5;  Lk 2:11).<br>
          b. Explain  the reality of &ldquo;peace to men&rdquo; as announced by the Angels. (Isa 9:6-7)<br>
          4. The  good news should be received without doubt and  shared  without delay. Discuss.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>If  Angels should proclaim Jesus and shepherds received it with joy, and tell  others, Christians of our own time should always share the good news received  with others without delay </p>

        TOPIC: LOOKING FOR JESUS<br />
        AIM: TO ENCOURAGE CHRISTIANS TO ALWAYS LOOK/SEEK JESUS AND GO WITH HIM.</strong></p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong></p>
<p align="justify">In line with their regular practice as devout Jews,  the parents of Jesus (Joseph and Mary) went to the feast of Passover with Jesus  when He was 12 years. At the end of the feast, supposing Him to be in the  returning crowd, they went without Jesus. After a day&rsquo;s journey, they realised  that Jesus was not with them and went back looking for Him until they found Him  on the third day and went with Him. </p>
<div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. How can you know one who has lost or has no  Jesus in  his/her life?<br>
          2. State and explain ways one can rediscover or  discover Jesus in his life<br>
          3. The parents of Jesus lost Him for three days  before they found Him. What special lesson has this for the children of God  (Heb 6:4-8).</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>Some people today move about without Jesus, others  who have Him before have lost him without knowing. To go without Jesus is the  most dangerous situation one can be in life. Check yourself, Are you without  Jesus? Look for Him now and always journey with Him.</p>

      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Jesus was invited to a marriage feast at Cana in  Galilee. During the occasion there arose a challenging, distressing and  embarrassing situation when the wine finished. The people approached Jesus with  the leading influence of his mother (Mary) who instructed them to do whatever  He told them to do. Then with strict obedience to Jesus&rsquo; instructions, water  was turned into wine and the situation brought under control. By doing that,  Jesus demonstrated the powerful hand of God at work in his ministry.</p>

      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Temptation is an inevitable factor of human life.  No matter how conscious and careful one may be, it must come as a reality of  life. It comes to different people in diverse ways. it comes to both the rich  and the poor, big and small, male and female. However, Christians are the  hardest hit if Jesus our great master was tempted. Therefore, Christians must  be ready to face it anytime it comes.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. What  do you understand by the word &ldquo;temptation&rdquo;?<br>
          2.  According  to Matthew 4:1, Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by devil, why? (Heb 2:17-18).<br>
          3a. Who  are the three chief agents of temptation to man?            (Job   2:7; Mtt 4:3; Jms 1:13-15; Rom 14:13; 1 Cor 8:9)<br>
          b. Explain  5 ways which temptation can come to Christians<br>

      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong></p>
      <p align="justify">The temptation of Jesus was a lesson of the  incarnation. In the incarnation, Jesus emptied himself of the form of God and  took upon himself the form of man just to identify with those he came to  deliver. He became man to the point of being tempted as man in hard, harsh and  agonizing ways. Jesus experience real torent, torment and turture as we feel  when we are severally tempted; but in all, He did not sin.   </p>
<div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1a. What is the central instrument of victory in  the three temptations of Jesus in Matt 4:4,7,10?<br>
          b. State how it can help those who are being  tempted today.<br>
          2. What other things do you think a Christian needs  to help him/her resist temptations? (Liv. 9:2, Eph. 6:10-20, James 4:7)<br>
          3. What value and benefit is the victory of Jesus  over temptations to us believers? (Heb 2:17-18, 4:15).<br>
          4. Temptation to sin is not sin but yielding to  temptation. Discuss.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>Christians have the power to overcome temptations  if only we can be strong in the Lord; always believing Him, trusting Him and  following Him, for He who is in us (the Holy Spirit) is greater that he  (Satan)  who is in the world.</p>

          TOPIC: GROWING THROUGH TEMPTATION<br />
          AIM: TO LET CHRISTIANS KNOW THAT TEMPTATIONS CAN BE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEVELOPMENT</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Humanly speaking, temptations do not give joy to  the tempted. It is therefore viewed with feelings of self-pity,, sadness,  dejection, depression and pain. However, temptations have some values  especially when they come for reasons of godly life in Christ. In that case,  they are occasions for growth, development and maturity.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. Discuss the general attitude of people to  temptation and state why it is so.<br>
          2. Why did James advise Christians to rejoice at  temptations and trials? (Matt 5:11-12; James 1:3-4, 12; Rev 2:10)<br>
          3. With practical life experience showed how  temptation can be of value to the tempted.<br>
          4. State, with scriptural references, three  instances where temptations led to promotion, growth or positive       development.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>Christians should uphold the great truth in the  words of William Barclay that; &ldquo;temptation is not meant to make us sin but to  enable us to conquer sin; not to make us bad, but to make us good; not to  weaken us, but to make us emerge stronger, finer and purer from the ordeal. It  is never the penalty but the glory of being a man.&rdquo;</p>

          TOPIC: JOY AFTER SORROW<br />
          AIM: TO ENCOURAGE CHRISTIANS THAT GOD WILL ALWAYS SEE US THROUGH IN EVERY CHALLENGE WE FACE.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English 5th  edition defines sorrow as a feeling of great sadness, usually because someone  has died or because something terrible has happened to you.<br>
      From this definition we could see that sorrow is a  product of events. Our Bible passage presented the story of two men who lived  in the same period but with different experiences. One had happiness first and  ended in sorrow while the later had sorrow then happiness. God never promised  us that we would not have difficult moments John 16:33. </p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. What  are the Causes of sorrow?<br>
              When  we received news contrary to our experience John 16:16;<br>
              Death  of loved one (Luke 7: 11-17)<br>
              Disappointment  by a friend (John 11: 21)<br>
              Childlessness  (1 Sam 1)<br>
              Sickness  (Mark 5:21-43 Etc etc)<br>
          2. How  do we behave when in sorrow?<br>
          We  are expected as Christians to pray, (1 Sam 1 :10-13,  James 5: 14-16) What a friend we have in Jesus....,  Paul and  Silas (Acts 16:16)<br>
          3. What  has God promised?              Psalm  30:5, Daniel 3:28-30<br>
          4. What  is the greatest joy?              (Luke  15:10, Marks: 36)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>God has promised us joy after sorrow, all we need  to do is to trust and obey Him in all our doings as He is the only one that can  turn our sorrow into joy. Our song says when we walk with the lord..... </p>

      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong></p>
      <p align="justify">One very important event after the ascension of  Christ He never        left us in doubt is the coming of the Holy Spirit.  John 14:16-18, Luke 24:49; Acts 1:8. Christ promised to send the Holy Spirit  when He left and He fulfilled the promise. The promised Spirit      that is the Holy Spirit guides every  believer/Christian in his/her daily living. One cannot be a Christian without  the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Therefore anyone in the church that does not  have the Holy Spirit should pray that God will endow you with this gift.</p>
<div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. Who  is the Holy Spirit? (John 15:26, Acts 5:3-4, John 14:26)<br>
          2. Who  made the promise? (Joel 2:28-29, Luke 24:49)<br>
          3. Has  the promise been fulfilled? (Acts 2:1-4)<br>
          4. Who  is the Holy Spirit meant for? (Joel 2:28-29)<br>
          5. <strong>What  are the Roles of the Holy Spirit to:</strong><br>
             The world; (John 16:7-11)<br>
             Children of God; (John 14:16, John  16:13, John15: 26;              I  Cor 12:3, Rom 8:26)<br>
             Christ; (John 16:14)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>The knowledge that the Holy Spirit of God has taken  up residence in our lives, that he performs all these miraculous functions,  that He dwells with us forever, and that He will never leave or forsake us is  cause for great joy and comfort. Thank God for His precious gift-the Holy  Spirit and His work in our lives!</p>

        TOPIC: MINISTERING TO THE LESS PRIVILEGED<br />
        AIM: TO TEACH BELIEVERS IN CHRIST TO UPHOLD A GOOD HOSPITALITY TO THE NEEDY.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">A privilege in this context can be seen as a right,  advantage, special favour or benefit available to anyone in a certain condition  or position. Here a less privileged is one partially or totally denied of such  advantages.<br>
        People destitute of the privileges of life have one  form of hollow or the other in their life that needs to be filled. Christians  have this as part of their call and commission. According to our text, Jesus  expects us to see that the brethren do not languish while we live lavishly in  the things of life. </p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. Mention the classes of people that can be  regarded as less 
            privileged?  (Exod. 4:11; Luke  4:13; Deut. 15:11; II King 24:14;            Heb. 5:2;, Eph. 6:5; Ps. 68:5.)<br>
          2. How can we effectively assist these group of  people? (Pvb. 3:28;, 
          Deut.  15:10; Rom. 15:37; Matth. 6:1-4; Rom. 12:8b; Luke 14:12-44;
          Gal. 6:2;  ICor. 12:9-10; I Tim. 5:3; Ps. 82:3.)<br>
          3. Let us examine how an individual Christian can  take up this ministry. 
          (Matth.  25:31-45)<br>
          4. What are the rewards of doing the ministry to  the less privileged?</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>The welfare ministry is one that Christ himself  emphasized. Those who carry out this work are directly affecting Him. Every  good Christian will like to have the testimony like Mary who anointed the body  of Christ. That you fed Jesus; clothed Him; visited Him. This will finally  bring you to the place of the blessed of the father on the last day. Why not  start with the needy in your neighbour hood.</p>

      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">As reconciled children of God, pleasing God in all  our activities should be the centre of our daily life. Col 3:2 enjoined us to  set our affection on things above and not on earth. John the Beloved summarized  what are below in I John 2:16. Considering this topic, it shows that though we  are in the world we are not of the world, Things in this world which will  eventually pass away should not take pre-eminence in our lives as Christians  since heaven is our target.</p>

        TOPIC: THE CHURCH, THE CALLED PEOPLE<br />
      AIM: TO ENCOURAGE US TO GET BEYOUND THINKING OF THE CHURCH IN HUMAN TERM</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">The  word &quot;Church&quot; is translated from the Greek word &quot;ekklesia&quot;  which means, called out&quot; and refers to an assembly or gathering of people  that has been called together: The Church refers to Christians who have been  called out of darkness into His light that we maybe obedient to His will, and  follow the example of Christ. The Lord spoke to His people through the apostle  Peter and used several terms in order to help them appreciate their spiritual  position in Christ. He referred to them as a &quot;chosen generation, holy  nation, and people for God's own 'possession.&quot; Christians are referred to  as &quot;the people of God&quot; and as having received God's mercy. This is  the result of God's grace and love not according to our own merit.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. What  do you understand by the term &quot;Church?&rdquo;<br>
          2. From  these passages, outline other terms used to describe the  church in the New Testament  (Eph. 1:21-23, 1 Cor. 3:16-17, John 19:36).<br>
          3a. What  are the main purposes of the Church? (1 Peter 2:9, Eph. 4:12, 1 Cor, 12:12-13].<br>
          b.  What are the necessary things required of the Church as the called  out people? (Matt. 28:18-20, 2Tim. 4:2, Acts  2:42-44, James 5:14-15]<br>
          4. Why  should a Christian be involved in Church? (Psalm 27:4, Hebrews 10:25, Ephesians  2: 19-20]<br>
          5. To  drive the message home; how did Jesus care for the church?  (Ephesians 5:23-27)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>The Church is a gathering of certain people,  namely, those that fit the description in our text (1 Pet 2:9, 10). God called  us out to live as His children, and render unto Him a loving, loyal service,  bearing His gentle yoke with cheerfulness and meekness, and so recommend the  service of God by our conduct before men, that they shall be drawn to God by  our example. God has issued the call. Have you answered to become one of those  &quot;called out?&rdquo;</p>

        <strong>Text: Deuteronomy 6: 4 - 12<br />
          TOPIC: LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD<br />
        AIM: TO TEACH US TO LOVE GOD WITH ALL OUR HEART, SOUL AND MIGHT.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">This passage is the meeting point of the law and  the Gospel. With the exception of the word &quot;life,&quot; love is the most  important abstract term in the Bible. Love is a very important idea for  Christians. Jesus taught that the greatest commandments were to love God and to  love our neighbours. He said that these two commandments summed up all the  commandments that God gave to Moses. The &quot;heart&quot; is the inner nature  of the man, including his intellectual, emotional, and cognitive futurities;  the &quot;soul&quot; is the personality, the entire self-consciousness; and the  &quot;might&quot; is the sum of the energies, bodily and mental. Not by  profession merely is God to be loved; the whole man, body, soul, and spirit, is  to be yielded to him in holy and devout affection. It is helpful to see what  the Bible tells us about love.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1a. How does God want us to love Him? (Matt. 22:37)<br>
          b). Why did God recommend loving Him with all our  heart, soul and might? (Matt. 6:22, Matt. 13:44]<br>
          2. Apostle John teaches that we should not love in  words nor in  tongues; how  then should we express our love for God? (I John 3:  18, Deut. 6:6-9, Ecc. 12:13, Exod. 20:2-7, Josh. 22:5)<br>
          3. From these passages identify those things that  propel our Love for God? (Psalm 116:1, 1 John 4:19, John 3:16)<br>
          4. &quot;We show our love to God by showing love to  others.&quot; Discuss in line with these passages. (Matt. 10:42, John 21:  15-17, Heb. 6:10)<br>
          5. What are the benefits of those who love the Lord  our God? (Heb.13:15, 1 Cor. 2:9, Psalm 23:6)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>What comes into our minds when we think about God  is the most important thing about us&quot; when we come into agreement with God  it awakens love in us. God wants us to love him, not for his benefit, but for  ours. He does, however, require that love for him be complete-with all our  heart, soul, mind, and strength. Loving God is continually refuelled when the  mind encounters truth over and over.</p>

        <strong>Text: Deuteronomy 7: 6 - 11<br />
          TOPIC: GOD'S CHOSEN PEOPLE<br />
          AIM: TO REMIND CHRISTIANS THEIR DUTY AS CHOSEN PEOPLE OF GOD BY FAITH</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong></p>
      <p align="justify">The term &quot;God's Chosen People&quot; is a common  strand of Israel's faith that they became the people of God because he chose  them to be his own possession. When God called Abraham to found the Jewish  nation, He separated him from the heathen around him, God promises to bless  when His people are separated from sin. As verse 10 reads; &quot;For thou art  an holy people unto Lord thy God&quot; - that is, see apart to the service of  God, or chosen to execute the important purposes of His providence. Their  selection to this high destiny was neither on account of their numerical amount  nor because of their extraordinary merits but it was in consequence of the  covenant or promise made with their pious forefathers. As children of Abraham  by faith, God has chosen us to be a special people unto himself above all  people that are upon the face of the earth; for special service and worship,  and to enjoy special privileges and benefits. </p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. Why are the Israelites the Chosen people of God?  (Deut. 6:7-8, Genesis  22:15-18)<br>
          2. What are the factors that were involved in God's  selection of Israel? (Psalm 23:3, Isaiah43:25)<br>
          3. How does God show that He values people? (2  Thess. 2:13, 1 Kings 8:16, John 3:16)<br>
          4.  Compare  (Deut. 7:6, 9-10) in line with (Exo. 32:4, 9-10, Hosea 1:3-9) what stand does  God take when His chosen people indulge in Christianized Idolatry? <br>
          5. In line with [1 Pet. 2:9, John 15:1-4, 16; Matt.  28:19, 20) outline the roles that God requires His chosen people to play in the  contemporary time.<br>
          b) Briefly explain some expected persecutions  awaiting the chosen people of God and possible ways of overcoming them. (John  15:18-27)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>We live in the days when the church and the world  are so mingled that it is 'difficult to tell who really belongs to Christ. We  have been called out of the world that we might be a testimony to the world  [John 15:16-27), Christians are chosen out of the world to be a'peculiar  people, to be holy here and happy hereafter; to enjoy communion with God in  this life and that to come, as well as to serve and glorify him now and for  evermore.</p>

        <strong>Text: Ephesians 5: 1 - 10<br />
          TOPIC: FOLLOW GOD'S EXAMPLE<br />
        AIM: TO ENCOURAGE US TO REFOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON CHRIST WHO IS OUR PERFECT EXAMPLE.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Paul calls his fellow Christians to follow God's  example in order to live up to the reputation of God's family. Christ is the  ultimate example of how to live a life that is pleasing to God. If we pattern  our lives after him, we will please God. Not only that, we will find ourselves  accepted into his eternal kingdom. Of course we find our ultimate role model in  Jesus Christ. Just as children imitate their parents, believers should follow  God's example. We can do that by following his example in Christ, emulating his  attributes in our lives (1 Peter 2:21). In other people, we find assorted  characteristics we would like to follow. In Jesus Christ, we find all of the  characteristics we would like to follow. When you have a question about what to  do, ask what Jesus would have done.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. What do you understand by the term  &quot;Following God's example?&quot;<br>
          2. Following God's example is becoming like Christ.  How do one become like  Christ? (Eph. 5:2, I John2:3, Luke 6:38, John 13:14-         15, Rom. 8:9)<br>
          3. What are the necessary things we need to put  aside in other to follow God's example? (Luke 9:23, Eph, 5:3-7)<br>
          4a. In following God's example we become an example  to others.  Discuss  in line with these passages (Titus 2:7, Eph. 5.10,1 cor.         11:1)<br>
          b) If people were to follow your example, would it  be easier for them to  believe  in Christ?<br>
          5. &quot;...and live a life of love, just as Christ  loved us...&quot;vs2. In what ways can we show Christ likeness to our enemies?  (Luke 6:32-33, Matt.    5:44, Gal.  5:22-23)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>To be a follower of someone is to pattern your life  after him or her. To be like Christ is our goal. We want to think his thoughts,  show his attitudes, live as he would live here on earth today. It is an awesome  goal, the key is that we are not Christ, but can only hope to be like him.  Christ likeness is following in Christ's footsteps. As we follow our Lord, we  attract others to follow him also. We are most like our Father, most godly,  when we allow that love to flow from us into the lives of others.        </p>

        <strong>Text: Acts 4: 34 - 37, 5: 1 - 11<br />
        TOPIC: GREED<br />
          AIM: TO POINT OUT AND REPROOF THE GROWING GREED AND ITS EFFECT IN THE CHURCH AND SOCIETY.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">The early church was characterized by the; Apostles  doctrine; sign and wonders and common share of possession. This was altered by  the attitude of Ananias and Sapphira and the act of murmuring of the Greecians  against the Hebrews because of neglect of their widows in daily ministration.  These vices were well handled by the early Church Apostles. Today although the  church is growing in Nigeria and other countries of the world, yet the rate at  which greed still rules the life of the leaders both the church and society  calls for a serious attention to revolve this trend.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. Point out the nature of greed in the characters  from the passages below. (Luke 12:16-20; 16:19-25; Acts 5:1-3; 6:1-2 and  Malachi 3:8)<br>
          2. Discuss the extent of the greed covetous  lifestyle in the church and   society  today. Use the bible passages above.<br>
          3. How can we repent and bring change to our church  and society? (Malachi 3:9,10; Acts 2:44-46; Acts 4:34-37; 6:2-4; 1Tim.  6:17-19.)<br>
          4. How  much can covetousness, greed and luxury affect our relationship with God?  (1 Tim. 6:6-10; Malachi 3:9; Luke 12:20-21;  16:22-26; Matt 25:41 - 46.)<br>
          5. How  can the church cut short on her luxurious living in order to care for the  needy?</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
          </strong>The present day Church/Christianity needs cure from  all forms of greed. We should emulate the early Church in their attitude to  giving and caring for the less privileged. Church leaders should also see that  items brought for welfare in the church must get to the rightful people.<br>
        The general budget of the church must include its  ministry to the needy. There is also the need to teach the church to do this  individually.</p>

        <strong>Text: Phil. 2: 5 - 11<br />
          TOPIC: THE LORDSHIP OF CHRIST<br />
          AIM: TO TEACH US THAT THROUGH YIELDING TO THE LORDSHIP OF CHRIST, WE WILL ACHIEVE VICTORY OVER THE FLESH.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">In almost every sphere of life, a form of  leadership is established. Each army has a general, each navy an admiral, each  ship a captain. Every known kingdom has its king and every home a head. But in  the kingdom of man's soul, with all its complex and baffling problems, it&rsquo;s  progress and victory may still be achieved. Impossible! Victory is only for one  who has submitted unreservedly and irrevocably to the Authority and Lordship of  Jesus Christ.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1(a) Explain  the implications of these parables as it relates to the Lordship of Christ   <br>
          (i)  The Prodigal Son; (Luke 15:11-32) (ii) The Lost  Sheep (Matt18:12) (iii) The Lost Coin (Luke 15:8,9;)<br>
          (1b). From the scriptures below discuss the lordship  of Christ. (Acts 9:4-6; 10:36; 1Peter 3:15; Rom. 14:8,9)<br>
          2. How can one enthrone and maintain the lordship  of Christ over one's life?  (Rom. 10:9; (Luke 6:46; Col. 3:15-17,23,24.)<br>
          3. Are there people who do not recognize the  lordship of Christ? How can we know them? (Phil. 3:18,19; II Tim. 3:8; Rom.  1:21-25; Titus 1:16.)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
          </strong>The Archbishop of Canterbury then, when placing the  crow on King George VI during his coronation asked; &ldquo;Sirs, I present to you  George your rightful king. Are you ready to pay homage?&rdquo; The affirmation  entails a disturbance authority. The same can be used for the lordship of  Christ when one submits to him. In some lives He will ban certain pleasure,  recreation, expenditure, association. <br>
        As the &ldquo;I will&rdquo; of a bridegroom submits to that of  a groom in a Holy matrimony so will ours be lost in that of Christ when we  totally submit to His lordship.</p>
<p><strong>Food for thought: </strong>Bring forth the Royal diadem and crown Him Lord of All.<br />

      Season: Pentecost Sunday</strong><br />
        <strong>Text: John 7: 37 - 39: 9: 1 - 6<br />
          TOPIC: THE FULLNESS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
          AIM: TO INSPIRE US TO ASPIRE FOR THE FULLNESS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT INDWELLING</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Today there are thousands of Christians living as  though there had been no day of Pentecost, as though there were no Baptism in  the Holy Spirit.
        Here, lies the root cause of our individual and  collective spiritual bareness and pitiable powerlessness.
        In John 7:37-39 Jesus gave a foreshadow of the Holy  Spirit outpour on the church of Pentecost. He portrayed a life of perennial  fullness, of torrential overflow.</p>
      <p align="justify">Paul's encounter with the Ephesian believers is  pointing to the fact that every believer needs water baptism as well as that of  the Holy Spirit. Hence He said in Eph. 5:18 &ldquo;be not drink with wine…, but be  filled with the Spirit&rdquo;. The Spirit-filled life is the life of the yielded  believer, dominated, controlled and empowered by the Holy Spirit. It is the  life of Christ manifested in the believer.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. What is  the purpose of the fullness of the spirit? (Acts 1:8; Acts 6:3; 4:8, 13:21;  13:9-11; Gal. 5:22-23; I Cor. 12:7; I Cor. 2:4.)<br>
          2. What are  the effects of the fullness of the spirit in the life of a believer?  (Isa.61:1-4; John 16:13,14; Luke 4:12; Rom.  8:11,14-16; Acts 4:33; I Cor. 2:4.)<br>
          3. Mention  some conditions for receiving the Holy Spirit? (Acts 2:38;  Rom. 8:5; Eph. 5:18; Luke 11:13; John  16:23,24; Gal. 3:14; I John 5:14-15; I Cor. 14:12.)<br>
          4. How can  we employ the gift of the Holy Spirit in our church today?   (I Cor. 12:27,28; ICor. 12:4-13; ICor.  13:1,2; Luke 10:17-19)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>Powerless and ineffective preaching and witness  would be unknown if all enjoyed the Spirit's fullness. After Pentecost Simon  became Peter that preached a sermon that pricked thousands of people unto  salvation. Baptism in the Holy Spirit is a subject that deserves emphatic  teaching and practice in our church today.</p>

        <strong>Text: Matthew 28: 16 - 20<br />
          TOPIC: THE HOLY TRINITY<br />
          AIM: TO REMIND THE CHURCH THE NEED FOR TEAM WORK/UNITY</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">The doctrine of the Trinity (from Latin trinitas  &ldquo;triad&rdquo;, from trinus &ldquo;threefold), define God as three consubstantial persons,  expression, or hypostases: the father, the son (Jesus Christ) and the Holy  Spirit, one God in three persons are distinct yet are one substance, essence or  nature. Matthew 28:19. &ldquo;Tri&rdquo; meaning three and Tri + Unity Gen 1:26 emphasized  one God. It is therefore not 1+1+1 = 3, it would be 1 x 1 x 1 =1.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1.            Do  we have three Gods: (Duet 6:4, Gen. 1:26 a &amp; b;)<br>
          2.            What  did Jesus say? (John 14:1, John 10:30, Matthew 28:19)<br>
          3.            What  is the impact of disunity among Christians in the world today?<br>
          4.            What  are the challenges we are bound to face when there is quarrel in Christendom? (Mark 3:24-25)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>Christ is the word of God made flesh, John 1:1-4,  He dwelled among us in human form. when he went back to the father sent His  Spirit (the Holy Spirit) to be with us. The Holy Trinity suggests to us that  the God-Head is one and Christians ought to be one body, soul and spirit  without which we cannot make the positive impact expected of us in this  generation. </p>

      <strong>Text: Luke 17: 7 - 10<br />
        TOPIC: SERVANTS OF THE KINGDOM<br />
    AIM: TO MAKE US UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE IDEAL CHRISTIAN SERVICE AND ITS EFFECTIVENESS</strong></p>
    <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
    <p align="justify">Today we don't have real slaves any longer. But in  the first century, there were genuine slaves. They were bought and sold. In the  above text, Jesus was talking to people who were conversant with the  implication of slavery. Jews have slaves and are well informed on the law of  slavery. Hence, Jesus used the word to buttress His teaching.<br>
      A slave is one who had lost everything in life,  including the personal right to life. He bears no name but tagged the name of  the owner 'Master'. He works without pay. No freedom, no choice, no right. So  Jesus must be cracking a joke when He talked about a master inviting his slave  to eat first after returning from work. In other words, they don't expect  reward or appreciation for any labour, for it is their reason for living.</p>
    <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
      <p>1. What category of people could be seen as God's  servants in the           church? (Luke  19:12-24; II Cor. 6:1-2; I Cor. 4:1, 12:20-23; Rom. 1:1,6.)<br>
        2. How can we appraise the attitude of people  towards the work of God? (Luke 16:13; John 6:27-29; Matth. 20:9-12)<br>
        3. Suggest the right attitude to the service of God<br>
        4. What benefit awaits good and faithful servants  of God?</p>
      <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
    </strong>This age is an era where gains rule the heart of  people. They work for the highest pay, compete for the highest gain. And in  this form of life, the winner takes it all. But servants of God should work as  people &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; serving a 'Master' who has bought them with a price. We are  really &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; of Christ bought with his blood to do His service. How can we  base our service on rewards?</p>

        The bible in Gen. 3:6 says &ldquo;And when the woman saw  that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eye…&rdquo;        The eye is the light of the body, through the focus  of which we usher in many things into our lives.<br>
        In our text, she saw Dinah the daughter of Jacob to  her and lavished because, she saw her as a prey to his desire. <br>
        Unfortunately, Shechem's list brought about the  destruction of his entire tribe by the sons of Jacob. All sins man commits are  products of lust. Stop the lust and stop the sins, but not by power not by  might but by the Spirit of God.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. What  is lust? (Jas 1:14-16; 4:1,2)<br>
          2.Identify  lust in its forms in these scriptural texts. (Num. 11:4,5; IISam. 13:1, 2, 10-14; Judges 14: 1-3;  16:1,4,5; Rom. 1:1-24, 26,27; Josh. 7:1, 21; IIKing 5:21-27)<br>
          3.Do  we experience and engage in these forms of lust today? Can we mention them?<br>
          4. Discuss  the consequences of the above lusts in the life of the culprits.<br>
          5.  How  can we avoid or escape luring situations? (Pvb.1:10,15;  Job 31:1)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>All forms of carnal desires lure people into sin  that could destroy them and even generations. The scriptures provided that we  flee from them like Joseph we can only run away from lust before we fall into  sin.</p>

          TOPIC: TEMPERANCE<br />
          AIM: TO TEACH US TO SEE THIS FROM OF SELF RESTRAINT TO CALM ALL THE TENSION AND WINDS OF ADVERSITY</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">An untested Christian experience is usually a weak  one. God desires our growth, so there are tests that promote growth. He has  given us the resources in the Lord Jesus Christ to stand every test.<br>
        Temperance according to Wycliffe Bible Dictionary  signifies moderation, continuance, or self restraint especially curbing one's  impulse for the sake of worthier end.        The biblical usage of the term means that a child  of God should submit to the control and indwelling Spirit rather than Spartan  self-denial.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. Point out the uncontrolled life-style in the  scriptures below. (Gal. 5:19-21; James 3:1-10; Eph. 5:18; Luke 21:34; Proverb.  20:1, 6:9-11; Titus 1:10,11.)<br>
          2. Which of the above excesses are found in the  church and society today. Discuss them.<br>
          3. What are the way by which we can control the  excesses mentioned above? (I Cor. 9:27; Luke 21:36; Gal. 5:23.)<br>
          4. What are the benefits of living a temperate  life? (I Cor. 7:27; Titus 2:1-8.)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>The term temperance entails self-crucifixion and  submitting to control by the indwelling Spirit. A moderate lifestyle is a  perfect work of the spirit and mark of total yieldedness to Christ. People who  are given to uncontrolled habits in certain areas of the life are advised to  take up a counseling and deliverance session with their local pastor. This is  because mere self will and decision may not achieve the desired result. Fasting  and prayer help one develop a victorious lifestyle.</p>

        <strong>Text: James 5: 13 - 16<br />
          TOPIC: MINISTERING DIVINE HEALING<br />
          AIM: THAT CHRISTIANS SHOULD BOLDLY MINISTER HEALING TO ONE ANOTHER BY FAITH</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">It is an established fact that Faith is an integral  part of healing for both the minister of God and those ministered to. But in  situations where God divinely intervenes, mercy rules. 
        God is willing to heal any one irrespective of the  nature of the sickness and diseases. No case is hopeless. Anointing breaks  every yoke.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1.Read the passage below and point out types and  nature of healing that took place in them. (John 5:5-6, 8-9; Mark 8:22-25;  Luke 17:12-18; James 1:6-8.)<br>
          2. How (by what means) should we minister healing  to the sick ones among us? (Matth. 8:7-3,13,15; Mark 16:17-18; John 9:1, 6-7,  Acts 19:11,12; Mark 6:13; Ps. 107:20; Matth. 8:16; II Kings 5:9-10, 14-15; Jas.  5:14, 15.)<br>
          3. Whose duty is it to minister healing to the  sick? (John 1:12;  II Cor. 1:21; Isa.  1:27; I Cor. 12:4-9, 28-30.)<br>
          4. Since our sickness can be healed by Divine  ministration, what                is the  place of hospital and drugs?</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>God has provided that the church carries to the  sick world His healing power. Every believer is a carrier of this grace for the  scriptures says that &ldquo;they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover&rdquo;.  This is the power of the church and we must use this to manifest the glory of  God in the world. Signs and wonder follow every step of faith. Pray for one  another that you may be healed.</p>

          TOPIC: CHRISTIAN INTEGRITY<br />
          AIM: TO IMPART IN THE LIFE OF BELIEVERS THE VIRTUE KNOWN AS INTEGRITY</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Christianity has been severally described as a way  of life. Christ–like life. It's a lifestyle above the worldly standard; a life  worthy of emulation.<br>
        In Isa. 59:15 The scripture says &ldquo;Truth is nowhere  to be found, and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey.&rdquo; But &ldquo;we are the light of  the world; the salt of the earth&rdquo;.<br>
        Integrity is defined as being honest and upright in  character, is a Christian virtue which we need to add to our faith I Peter  1:5.  The world is full of evil,  corruption and is gradually decaying. No one could be trusted&rdquo;.<br>
        In every generation, God still counts on someone,  as epitome of godliness. One who becomes a reference point to his or her generation.  Enoch, Noah, Job, Abraham, Daniel and the Apostles were called Christians  because of their life. Who will preserve our generation by becoming an example?</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. In what areas did the characters in the texts  below show integrity? (Gen. 12:12; 1Sam. 12:2-4; II Kings 5:15-17; Gen.  39:6-12; Dan.1:8; ICor. 9:20-27; Acts 20:18-38.)<br>
          2. How can we live and maintain this life of  integrity?  (Rom. 8:8-14;  Gal. 5:22-25; Eph. 5:18-21; Col. 3:1,2,8-10;  Heb 11:24-26; I Cor. 4:1,2; Titus 2:7-12.)<br>
          3. How can we possibly show integrity in our day to  day activities?<br>
          4. Mention some benefits of living in integrity?  (Dan. 1:9,20,21; Gen. 41:39-43; II Tim. 4:7,8.)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>Until the life of Christ is seen in a believer his  or  her conversion is yet doubtful. This  is because there are many who profess Christ, but live contrary. The life of an  unbeliever should not be more upright than that of a Christian. Our integrity  reflects the Christ in us and even becomes part of the epistle read from us.  Write your epistle live the life.</p>

          TOPIC: DO NOT GIVE UP<br />
          AIM: TO ENCOURAGE THE FAITHFUL NOT TO DESPAIR</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">This daughter of Abraham had been facing her storms  of life for eighteen years. Yet she never gave up, but believed that she could  one day receive a divine visitation. Her infirmity was not a reason. She was  always at the place where the Day and Word of God were honoured. There she  eventually found solution. </p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1.Jesus  acknowledged that woman as a &ldquo;daughter of Abraham&rdquo; vs16, Why then should she be  allowed to suffer affliction? <br>
          2.Why  did the woman not relent from going to place of worship, despite her  sickness?  (Psalm 121:1-2; Rom 8:37-39.)<br>
          3. She  came to Church sorrowful, but went home joyfully, Lk. 13:12-13. Why? <br>
          4. What  advice can we give to those who do not go to Church due to illness, health or  financial challenges? </p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>Children of God should never give up but be  faithful in the Almighty power of Jesus Christ. He who met this daughter of  Abraham is our Saviour. He will never let us down. Those who spend Sundays in  idleness, pleasure, Age Grade Meetings, wild parties and businesses, in order  to meet the challenges of this life, should emulate this woman. </p>

          TOPIC: IDENTIFYING THE STRANGE GOSPEL<br />
          AIM: TO LEARN THAT COUNTERFEIT MINISTERS ABOUND</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Reading Lev. 9-22-24 we understand why Nadab and  Abihu went to imitate the men of God. Here the glory of the Lord proceeded the  presence of Moses and Aaron who came to bless the people. Divine fire also came  and consumed their offerings. Nadab and Abihu saw these and wanted to imitate  (10:1-2). The result was terrible. </p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. Nadab and Abihu were sons of Aaron the High  Priest. What do you think that led them  into offering profane fire before the Lord? (Prov. 16:18; Prov. 11:12.)<br>
          2. Identify the spiritual difference in the  attempts of Elisha and  that  of sons of Scaeva. Read (2 Kgs 2:13;Acts 19:14-16.)<br>
          3. What do (you think is the implication of  preaching strange gospel? (Acts 19:13; Gal. 1:8-9 Rev. 22:18-19.) <br>
          4. What advice can we give those who call themselves,  make Robes, Copes, and make themselves Bishops and Archbishops? </p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>Those who God calls, He equips. God is not an  author of confusion. Those who call themselves can be said to be offering  profane sacrifices. These are easily identified, because by their fruits they  shall be known. </p>

          AIM: TO TEACH THAT JESUS LOVES AND DESIRES THAT WE BE SAVED</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">This is one of the passages where Jesus used  allegory to teach about the willingness of God to share with us the glory of  His kingdom. As adamant as the Jews, many   seem resolved to remain in their comfort zones. Sad still, many have not  understood that eternal relief is found in Christ. </p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. Jesus Christ has promised rest to the weary. Why  is that many who labour and are heavy laden, seem to harden their hearts?  (Psalm 95:7-8; 1 Cor. 1:18)<br>
          2. When Jesus said, 'In my Father's House, there  are many mansions; what does He Mean? (Jn. 14:2a.) <br>
          3. Those invited to the feast gave different  excuses. Do people of this generation give similar excuses today?    (Lk 14:18a Lk9:59-62.)<br>
          4a. What does Jesus mean when He said &ldquo;Go…compel  them to come … (Lk 14:23. Read Lk.  10:11-12, 2Tim 4:2.)<br>
          b. Who do you think were the men originally  invited? (Lk 14:24.)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>The  song writer says &ldquo;earnestly Jesus is calling all sinners come home!&rdquo; He does  not desire the death of a sinner. However, as we continue in our  stiff-neckedness, the time of grace is fast elapsing. The time to taken part in  the feast of the Lord is now. Tomorrow may be late</p>

          TOPIC: SAMBALLAT IS MY FATHER-IN-LAW<br />
          AIM: TO WARN CHRISTIANS ABOUT UNHEALTHY MARRIAGE</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Nehemiah 4 clearly narrated how wickedly Samballat  as an individual, Ashdod, Ammon and Moab as nations, treated the Israelites  when they returned from exit. It could not be imagined that men of Judah went  to marry the women from these nations. Worse still the son of a High Priest  went to have Samballat as a Father-In-Law. 
        This unhealthy cross-pollination has drifted many  away from the faith. </p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. What do you think are the reason why Abraham  instructed that Isaac should marry from his kinsmen? (Gen. 24:3-4.)<br>
          2. Are the opinion of fathers still necessary when  it comes to choice of marriage? (Gen. 24:7-8, Judges 14:3. )<br>
          3. What are the impending dangers that may follow  marriage of women of different religions? Discuss in line with:<br>
          a.            Betrayal  - (Judges 16:19-21)   b. Apostasy (I kgs  11:7-9)<br>
          c.            Backsliding  - (2 Cor. 6:14-15)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>Marriage is good in its entirety and honourable  before God. Yet God did not approve some marriages due to the adverse influence  that will emanate from such. The Israelites had for many times been lured into  apostasy due to marriage of foreign women. The same applies to many men and  women, especially Christians. Many have fallen from grace to grass, and have  lost their lights of the faith.  </p>

      <p align="justify">When Jesus heard that Lazarus was sick, he did not  take the next available flight to their house. Yet Lazarus family was friendly  with Jesus. The fact that we are Christians does not exempt us from the storms  of life. It rather exposes us to the devil's danger list. But the difference is  that God wants to use these storms to disgrace our adversaries, and lift us up  to a higher ground. </p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. Jesus  loved Lazarus and his sisters, yet when He heard that Lazarus was sick, He stayed  where He was for two more days. (Vs 5,6). How does this apply to us in our  stormy situations? (Job 19:25,) <br>
          2. Paul  was always excited when challenges hit him. Why? (Rom 5:3-5)<br>
          3. An  adage says; &ldquo;A path with no obstacles does not lead anywhere&rdquo; How true it? (Matt. 7:13-14. Psalm  126:5-6.)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>One could imagine the excitement in Samson when he  said, &ldquo;out of something strong comes something sweet&rdquo;. God will never allow a  storm in our lives if He has no plan to use that storm to lift our lives to the  promised land. Fear Not. No storm will swallow you up because Your God is  working on a special plan for your tomorrow. Peace. </p>

          TOPIC: FROM LIMPS TO LIFT<br />
          AIM: TO TEACH THAT GOD CAN CHANGE A STATE OF HOPELESSNESS TO HOPEFULNESS</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">We may recall correctly the story of Jacob in its  entirety. He is the same man taking his destiny with his own hand. Jacob  engaged an Angel in a struggle all through the night, just to re-write his  story. He got what he wanted but not without a scare. His name changed to  Israel. The cross is the sure way to the crown. </p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. What actually motivated Jacob to wrestle with  the Angel all through the night? <br>
          2. Nothing good comes so easy. How does this apply  to Jacob's situation? <br>
          3. Paul once pleaded that his 'limps' be taken  away. What            answer did he get?(2  Cor. 12:8-9.)<br>
          4. &ldquo;My power is made perfect in weakness&rdquo;. There is  ability in    disability&rdquo;. &ldquo;In my weakness  lies my strength&rdquo;. How true are these statements? (1 Cor. 1:27-29.)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>Jacob limped for the rest of his life Paul suffered  sight problem for the rest of his life. Amidst the storms of life, the spirit  of God wants us to know that our limps will lead to our destined life. No  challenge should stop us. Whether your cross disappears or not, let your life  be sold out on the altar of your God. </p>

          TOPIC: IT IS COURAGE NOT FEAR<br />
          AIM: TO TEACH THAT STORMS OF LIFE CAN BE OVERCAME THROUGH COURAGE</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">When anybody pays attention to the voice of fear,  it becomes difficult to hear the wisdom of faith and courage. When anybody is  looking at the picture that fear is painting, it becomes difficult to see the  vision of victory that God is gaining. It was fear that robbed Barak the glory  of delivering the Isralites from the hand of King Jabin of Cannan. </p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. Storms of life rage more when the devil grabs  one with fear. Do you agree? (Mk 4:40)<br>
          2. Why was it that Saul, Despite his height, could  not face Goliath? (1 Sam. 17:33, Num. 13:31.)<br>
          3. Joshua was able to weather all the storms to the  Promised Land. What was his secret? (Numbers 13:30, Joshua 1:9.)<br>
          4a. Is the Spirit of God happy with us when we  express fear? (Gal. 5:5;)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>God  says 'fear not'. Dot not give place to fear. Without fear, the devil is  paralysed. Put an end to all fears today. Boldly step out on the Word of God  and expect Him to do what He has promised to do</p>

          TOPIC: INTEGRITY AMIDST STORMS OF LIFE<br />
          AIM: TO ENABLE US TO HAVE CARRIAGE OF OUR CHRISTIAN CHARACTERS, IN ADVERSE CONDITION.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">In a very simple term, integrity is the ability to  have carriage of oneself in any circumstance. When one refuses to change with  the prevailing (unpalatable) situation, one is said to be of high  integrity.  God recognized this character  in Job when he was trading along the rough path of life. </p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. Read Luke 3:10-14 and explain what integrity  means. <br>
          2. What are some of the challenges of maintaining  integrity in our lives? (Dan. 6:3-5, Lk. 3:19-20.) <br>
          3. Enoch, Abraham, Daniel, etc, were men of old  with outstanding integrity. Outline what made them unique. (Heb.11:5,8, Dan.  6:4,10.)<br>
          4. Are the Challenges/storms of life any reason to  betray the     benefits we enjoy by  maintaining our integrity?  (Heb.  11:11-12; Dan. 6:25-28.)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>It  is indeed rewarding to have carriage of ourselves, especially in challenging  situations. Many may risk betraying their integrity due to one challenge or the  other. God will be proud of us and make special mention of us when we live  lives of integrity. </p>

          TOPIC: THE TRAITOR'S KISS<br />
          AIM: TO ALERT BELIEVERS TO BEWARE OF FALSE BROTHERS.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">The worst aspects of challenges of life are enemies  within. Julius Cesar could not have died if not for the sword of his friend,  Brutus. The traitor's Kiss is not only unprecedented but also betraying. <br>
        Jesus may not have been surprised over the  traitor's Kiss, but the relationship. Surely challenges of life are bound to  come but from which angle and which person?.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. Identify different sources of &ldquo;Traits in our  lives  (Matt 24:7a, 9.Lk 22:48, Matt  10:21-22, 36.)<br>
          2. What is expected of a Child of God who finds Him/Herself  amidst traitors? (Lk 22:49) <br>
          3. In what ways can a Child of God be Victorious in  the midst of traitors (Matt. 10:16-17,19-20.) <br>
          4. I s a Child of God expected to revenge, even the  traitor's kiss? Give reasons to your answer. </p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>It is a fact that many are passing through the  storms of life due to the betrayal of their brothers, friends or relatives.  Whatever it may be, God says 'Vengeance is mine', and, when I will fight your  battle, only you will be watching'.</p>

          TOPIC: GOD'S EVER READINESS TO HELP HIS CHILDREN<br />
          AIM: TO TEACH CHRISTIANS TO ALWAYS LOOK UP TO GOD FOR HELP</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">THE Psalmist in our text seems to be passing  through some difficulties and challenges of life that have so much weighed him  down and frustrated. Probably he must have tried all he could for solution but  all to no avail. Therefore, having tried all humanly known avenues for help, he  decided to look up to God as his last resort. The Psalmist proved God's  readiness to help whenever we call on Him with total surrender and submission.  Having looked up to the mountains and hills he decided to rely only on God for  solution to his entire problems.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1.   From the  travail of the Psalmist, mention the typology of the hills being looked upon  for help by some people today when in difficulty (Ps 121:1)<br>
          2.   In line  with these biblical texts and other biblical examples what should be our first  point of call when faced with difficult challenges? (Psalm 30:6-8, 2kings  4:18-22, Mathew 26:38-39)  <br>
          3. Give any reason why some find it difficult to  turn to God, especially when they are passing through difficult time (Psalm  20:7)<br>
          4.  With any  biblical evidence mention the negative implication of not looking up to God  when facing challenging situations.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>God is waiting to respond to the plea of His  faithful children for help unto Him, for He knows that we can do nothing  without Him. Learn today to always call on God anytime you seem to be helpless  or whenever you are in need of help.</p>

          AIM: TO CHALLENGE CHRISTIANS TO TAKE POSITIVE DECISION THAT WILL BETTER THEIR LIVES CIRCUMSTANCES, HOMES, CHURCHES AND OTHER SOCIAL MILIEU THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Success in life is governed and determined by an  inwardly propelled willingness to take decision on the progressive. When things  are not getting on accordingly as expected or when things have gone wrong, or  when situations are going wrong, persons who can rise up to take a decisive  decision for a change are often needed. These persons or individuals are often  poised with the passion to bring about a positive change, they aimed at  changing the status quo. It is said that nothing is permanent, but change alone.<br>
        Nehemiah having understood the shamble and pitiable  condition of the Jews at home took a costly and decisive decision to rise up to  the challenge to rebuild his homeland not minding all the obstacles. Until  Nehemiah took that decision, the Jews had remained complacent and defeated in  their consciousness. So, it takes a single decision of an individual in the  right direction with God to spur others into action that will bring about the  required change in any giving situation.      </p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. What  are the dangers and fears that may likely prevent people from taking decision  for a change? Give practical example. (Neh. 2:19; Neh. 3:12-15.)<br>
          2. What  prompted the unanimous decision by the Jews &ldquo; let us Rise up and build, (Neh  2:17-18?)<br>
          3. Mention  illustratively those aspects of our Christian lives, family and church that  need strong decision for a positive change to occur. <br>
          4. What  necessary steps are Christians expected to take before taking any  decision?  (Psalm 37:5 ) </p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong> There is  nothing impossible for God to do, He rules and reigns in the affairs of men,  and when we do His will and obey Him He will always guide us into taking decisions  that will transform our lives, Church and immediate environment. &ldquo;For it is God  that works in us both to will and to do of His good pleasure&rdquo;. Rise and take  that decision that will bring about a positive Change.</p>

          TOPIC: ALWAYS BE THANKFUL<br />
          AIM: TO TEACH CHRISTIANS TO ALWAYS BE THANKFUL NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Here Apostle Paul encourages Christians to always  be thankful in all things. It is obvious that problems and troubles of life do  confront us most often, and there are times we do not even understand why and  how they occur. One thing is certain when such situation occurs, it is that we  can always be thankful for many things. God loves us, Jesus died for us and  liberated us all, most especially from various cultural and foundational  bondages. Therefore in the midst of life uncertainties we must learn to be  thankful knowing what God has done for us Jerem. 29:11.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1.  Why  should we always be thankful to God bearing in mind role of Jesus earthly  ministry in the liberation of women? (Eph 5:20, Col 3:17, Rom 1:8)<br>
          2.  Briefly  explain how we can express our thankfulness to God despite all odds according  to (Phil 4:4-7)<br>
          3.  Faith  without work is dead (James 2:17) in line with this text, can a faithless  believer still be thankful to God in times of trials especially in his/her  service to God and that of community? Discuss  </p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>God is in control of every circumstances of life,  he understands every difficulty and troubles we are facing, therefore He wants  us to be courageous and thankful to Him in all circumstances of life. Being  thankful always shows our faith and confidence in God and the devil is put to  shame when he sees us being thankful always. </p>

          AIM: TO TEACH CHRISTIANS THE NEED TO INVOLVE GOD IN WHATEVER THEY DO ESPECIALLY IN THEIR PLANNING AND BUDGETING.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">The Bible made it clear to us in Gen. 1:1 and John  1:1ff that God is the beginning of everything both living and non-living  things. Rev. 1:8 says that God is the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the  end. This entails that if one must make any meaningful Success in life; he or  she must depend and involve God in all his/her planning from the beginning to  the end.<br>
        Suffice it to say that a lot of people today  including Christians make wide range of planning without bringing God into it  and this normally result into failure of such project. God is the solid and  sure foundation for the success of any project. Our text is the response of our  Lord Jesus Christ to a covetous young man who instead of listening to the  teachings of Christ was absorbed into the subconscious quest for material  possession. To this man there is no room for God in his desires or plans. It  was in the course of this response that Jesus narrated the parable of the rich  man, who strongly believed in his personal ability to plan and execute without  any reference and dependence on God. This rich man failed because he did not  recognize that man proposes but God disposes (James 4:13-15) in this study we  shall be praying God to help us learn and understand the secret behind  recognizing God in all our planning and projects.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1.  What is  covetousness and its implications in our relationship with God and
            our  fellow human beings? (Luke 12:13-14)<br>
          2.   Mention  some of the good qualities found in the rich man and what do you
          think  is his problem with God?<br>
          3.  Read  1Chron. 17:1-2 compare David's and the rich man's attitude towards God in  their planning. And what lesson can we learn from both?<br>
          4.   Considering the rich man's attitude to that of contemporary  Christians today,  to what extent are we different from him in our giving to God today.<br>
          5.  Using any  biblical and practical examples, explain the benefits and the dangers  of involving and not involving God as the case may be in our planning
          and  projects.<br>
          6.  Highlight  some of the ways we can involve God in our daily livings.</p>

          TOPIC: A LIFE FULL OF FEAR<br />
          AIM: TO SHOW CHRISTIANS HOW FEAR REPLACES FAITH AND CONFIDENCE WHEN WE ALLOW THE DEVIL TO GET US OFF THE PRESENCE OF GOD</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Fear is that force that inflicts insanity and undue  restlessness in man's attitude to situation around him. God instructed Adam and  Eve not to eat of the fruit of the tree of Knowledge of good and evil (Gen  2:16-17). Adam and Eve disobeyed God which consequently brought fear into their  lives. When God called in the cool of the day as usual, Adam and Eve had lost  their identity and confidence to stand before God and thus their hearts were  filled with fear.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1.     What  do you think is the major reasons why Adam and Eve hid themselves? (Gen3:8,11;  Prov. 28:1; Isa. 33:14.)<br>
          2.     What  are the causes of fear today in some of our Churches and Christendom? (Acts  19:13-16; 1Sam.15:24)<br>
          3.    (a)  Compare the fear in Adam (Gen.3:10) with that in Jehoshaphat in (2 Chron.  20:1-3)   (b) where do we run to when we  are afraid? (2 Chron. 20:3; Ps. 56:3.)<br>
          4.    How can  the fear of God eliminate fear that comes from sin? (2 Chron. 20:3; 17:3-6)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>Immediately a believer deserts the presence of God,  confidence, hope, and faith in life is lost and it is replaced with fear  of  uncertainty.</p>

          TOPIC: EXCELLENT LIFE<br />
          AIM: TO ENLIGHTEN CHRISTIANS ON THE FACT THAT MAINTAINING A HEALTY RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD CAN MAKE ONE TO EXCEL AND OVERCOME STORMS OF LIFE.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Daniel with some other Jews went down to Babylon as  captives, it was a difficult time for them, yet Daniel maintained an excellent  life. It was the tradition of the Babylonians to feed the wise men of the land  with the king's meal and wine. Daniel rejected the king's meal and wine. It  will take men who dwell in the presence of God, and sold out to Him, to deny  themselves of worldly delicacies in such a trying period (Ps 141:4; Prov.  23:1-2). Because of these denials, God made Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and  Abednego to excel above all other wise men of the land. This shows how our  fellowship with the Lord will earn us an excellent life which will place us  above our contemporaries. </p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. What  do you understand by excellent life? (Dan. 1:20; 2:48)<br>
          2. What  was the basis for the excellent life of Daniel and his friends? (Dan. 1:8; 2:17-19,28a.)<br>
          3. How  can we excel in our day to day activities as civil servants, traders, students, pensioners etc?  (Gen. 45:8;) 1Sam.  2:7; Jerem.4:14; 2Tim. 2:21; 1John 3:3 <br>
          4. How  can godliness earn us excellence in our studies or Careers? (1 Tim 4:8; 6:5-6)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>We should know that excellence comes from God; He  alone gives constantly to those who constantly trust, dwell in His presence and  abide by his teachings.</p>

          TOPIC: AN ACCURSED LIFE<br />
          AIM: TO TEACH CHRISTIANS THAT DISOBEDIENT TO GOD'S WORDS AND INSTRUCTIONS ATTRACTS CURSE AND PAINFUL EXPERIENCE</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">An accursed life is a life that has a curse on and  so is devoid of God's blessing. It is a life full of sorrow, anguish, regrets  and in fact all manner of storms of life. In our text today, Jeremiah  proclaimed God's judgment upon Israel because of their disobedience to God.  (Jer. 11:3,7-8) God regarded their disobedience as conspiracy and therefore  promised to remove his blessings from their lives. We should know that whenever  any person lives in unrepentant disobedience to God, such person will  definitely lose the blessings of God and inherit curses (Deut. 28:15ff)</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. (a)  What do you understand by an accursed thing?  (Josh. 6:17; Rom. 9:3; Gal. 1:8, 9.)        <br>
          (b) Give  practical examples<br>
          2.  What  are the reasons for the curses placed on the following people and things in the  Bible?                     <br>
          (a)  Cain- (Gen. 4:10-12)<br>
          (b)Adam  and Eve- (Gen. 3:16-19)<br>
          (c)  Serpent- (Gen. 3:14-15)<br>
          (d) Fig Tree- (Math 21:18-19)<br>
          3. How  can we avoid being accursed persons from the above?<br>
          4.  Accursed  persons cannot enter into God's blessings except there is restoration. How can  this be  possible? (1John 1:9; Rev. 2:5;  Gal. 3:10, 13-14)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>We invite curses into our Lives when we disobey the  commandments of  God, (Mal. 3:8,9). It is  only in obedience that we can have a blessed sustenance for our life.</p>

      <p align="justify">To overcome is to succeed in dealing with or  bringing under control a problem that has been preventing us from achieving  something. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were persecuted because they refused  to worship the king's golden image. Despite the suffering they encountered,  they all had confidence that their God will save them (Daniel 3:24-29). The  grace of God enabled them to rejoice in their tribulation and God consequently  gave them victory at last.</p>
<div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1.What  do you understand by tribulation? (Matt. 24:9-13; Dan. 3:14-15.)<br>
          2. How  would you describe the attitude of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in time of  tribulation? (Daniel. 3:16-18)<br>
          3. What  should be the attitude of Christians today when persecuted for the gospel's  sake? (Ps. 27:1-3; Luke 21:12-14; 1Pet. 2:13; Rev. 2:10)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>Whoever faces troubles and trials as a Christian  should be glad because our trials today will lead us to the future glorious  victory.</p>

      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">What great relief to find a place of peace in the  presence of God in a world full of confusion, hardship, hatred and great  wickedness, (Jn. 16:33). This peace is obtainable in Christ (John 14:27) it  begins in our heart through salvation and remains as long as we remain  consistent in Him. God desire for us especially in the stormy circumstances of  our lives is to bring us into the peace which His presence guarantees. </p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>

          2. Where  and how can we find the peace in God's presence? (Isa. 9:6; Matt. 11:28-30;  John 14:6, 27; 16:33; Rom 5:1.)<br>

      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">In the context of our theme, storms of life simply  means adversities, of life. Dictionary describes it as hardship, difficulty,  danger, misfortune, etc. life provides many occasions to experience adversity,  and sometimes circumstances of life can become almost too much to bear. In the  face of the above, many people are confused on this matter of adversity. In  this study we are going to locate God in all our afflictions and cling on Him  to see us through.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. Mention  some storms or adversities that face us today?                (Isaiah 1:5-6, Job 1:7.)<br>
          2. How  do people react in the face of adversity? (Ps 22:1, Ruth 1:13-14.)<br>
          b. Be  frank, how do you react when storms of life come to your way?( Ps 46:1, Ps  91:1-2.)<br>
          3. Is  it easy to see God or believe in him in the face of trouble? If yes how? If no  why? (Acts 16:25-26)<br>
          4. What  do you say about the Igbo adage &ldquo;Ejighi anya di nma aba uka ekpere&rdquo; is it  applicable to our Christian faith? (Romans 8:35-39.)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>Debates  on the subject of suffering and adversity have been going on for Centuries. But  there is an answer to this adversity in the scripture. To live faithfully in  the face of danger. Faith is the answer plus patience. The formula for storms  of life is: </p>
        <p>Faith + patience =victory.</p>

          TOPIC: SURE ANCHOR IN THE FACE OF STORMS<br />
         AIM: TO ENCOURAGE US TO REMAIN FAITHFUL TO GOD IN THE FACE OF DIFFICULTIES (II)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">The world is full of challenges. As Christians we  are not exempted from the struggles and storms of life. It is clear that pain  whether emotional or physical is a wonderful and fearful paradox. Almost  everyone experiences problems and adversity. Since storms of life can be fall  everyone irrespective of one&rsquo;s Christian background, this bible study, by the  grace of God will help us to learn how to deal with adversity so that when it  comes, we can walk through it and not be overtaken by it.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1.Do  troubles come from nature or from God or from man? Discuss this in the light of  (Job 5:6-7, Ruth 1:20)<br>
          2. When  storms/troubles strike some sink while others soar: there are some qualities in  a man that enable one sinks and other soar. Discuss those qualities for:<br>
          a. Those who sink (Tim. 4:10 )<br>
          b. Those who soar (1 Cor. 10:13, Eph. 4:2, Rev.  2:10)<br>
          3. Consider  Job 42:2, Job despite all his challenges in life decree that&rdquo; God is almighty.  Discuss practical ways you can encourage a friend who is almost frustrated in  facing the storms of life? (Phil. 4:6, Gen. 18:14, Ps 37:5.)<br>
          4.  How  did Job respond to adversity, compare Job's response with that of his wife?  (Job 19:25,2:10). b. do people react today as Job or Job's wife? Give reasons.<br>
          5. Many shrines, occult altars, so called prayer houses are being patronized by  our members for solution to their problems. What will be the duty of the church  to tackle the above problems?</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>Storms of life can be experienced by both Christian  and non-Christian. When they come, you either sink or soar. To sink is to seek  solution by all means. But be warned. You can multiple your storms and even  make it worse in the cause of solution. Be ye a faithful Christian not a  solution seeker.</p>

          TOPIC: SOARING ABOVE THE STORM<br />
        AIM: TO ENCOURAGE US TO REMAIN FAITHFUL TO GOD IN THE FACE OF DIFFICULTIES (III).</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Eagle is a bird that is wonderfully made. It is  made with quality that enables it to soar above storm, advances in the storm  and never grows weary. We must remember that as far as earth remains the pains  abound John 16:37. If this is so, is it really possible to soar on wings like  eagle? Can we really run and not grow weary, rising above the storm that  sometimes come our way? Answer is yes especially if you are a follower of Jesus  Christ. This study will help us to learn the qualities of an eagle and apply  same to our storms.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. Discuss  the qualities of an eagle that makes it to tilt over the storms. Eyes, wings  etc?(Isaiah 40:31, Ps 103:5 )<br>
          b.  How  can we put on eagles qualities to be able to soar above storm (Ps 103:5, 2cor.  6:14, Prov. 29:18)<br>
          c. Who  can be compared as eagle Christian and who can be compared as sparrow  Christian?<br>
          d. Read Exodus 19:1-6, how is God like an eagle? Can we be eagles in the line to  our brother Christian?</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>The most important lesson we can learn from the  eagle is this: no matter how fierce the storm, the eagle's safety depends on  the tilt of its wings. The stronger the storm, the higher the eagle rises. May  God help us to learn how to tilt our wings of faith so that every adversity can  advance us and bring us closer to God.</p>

        <strong>Text: 1 Thessalonians 4: 13 - 18<br />
          TOPIC: THE POWER OF HIS COMING <br />
        AIM: AT THE END OF THIS STUDY, THE HOPE OF CHRIST COMING WILL BE MADE ANEW</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p>In classical Greek, the word Parousia simply means the presence or arrival of  persons or things. Quite often, Paul uses Parousia in this sense. He rejoices  at the arrival of Stephens in 1Cor. 16.17 comforted by the presence of Titus  2Cor. 7.6 etc. Parousia in New Testament can also mean, the second coming of  Jesus Christ Matt. 24.3, 27, 37, 39. Parousia is expounded in the age of Jesus  Christ as the arrival of an emperor, king or Governor. And for such visit,  preparations have to be made. In our study today, we are going to reflect on  the joy which Jesus' presence will bring and also urges us to always be  prepared for His coming.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. In  your own simply thinking, what do you understand by the word 'Advent'? Do you  agree with the saying that the death of someone is his Advent/Parousia? (Rev.  22.7;Matt. 24.3, 27,37,39)<br>
          2.  Is  the message of Parousia or second coming still paramount in our pulpit today?  If yes how if no why? (2Tim. 3.1-6 )<br>
          3.  How  do you relate the contemporary message coated with Materialism and prosperity  with the real message of Parousia? (2Peter 2.1-8, Eph. 5.6, 
          Phil.3.18-19)<br>
          4. In  the face of storms and adversities of life, can the message of parousia be     seen relevant and useful? (John 16.33, Ps  30.5, Job. 14.7)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
          </strong>The message of Advent gives us three lines of admonitions:<br>
          1. Christ must surely come at the time we least  expected him, and Christians should present their lives blameless before Him<br>
          2. It admonishes Christians to be patient in the  face of storms with the ultimate hope that the day of His  coming will right all wrongs.<br>
        3. Heaven is real and hell is also real</p>

        <strong>Text: Romans 8: 26 - 29<br />
          TOPIC: GOD'S GOOD PURPOSE<br />
        AIM: TO ASSURE US THAT GOD KNOWS WHAT WE ARE PASSING THROUGH AND HE WILL OFER HIS HELPING HAND</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">There is no situation out of which God cannot work  good. The passage before us is the most memorable biblical statement on the  theme of God's good purposes for man even when it seems dark. The value of this  passage is not that it explains suffering but that it affirms the purpose of  God amidst suffering. Paul did not say that God is directly responsible for all  things; what he said was, in everything God works for good. In everything that  happens under the sun. God continues to interact with unimaginable good, a good  that overwhelms evil. In this study, God invites us to co-operate with him by  loving him and trusting him.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. What  do you understand by &ldquo;all creature groans &ldquo;in Romans 8:22 ?<br>
          2.Give  practical ways in which the nature groans and how it affects man? (Isaiah  1:5,7, Jeremiah 12:411)<br>
          3.  How  can our sufferings be turned to good. Give biblical examples (Gen.37.27ff)  Share your experience(s) with others? (Romans 8:31 )<br>
          4. God  cannot separate from us. It is man that usually separates from God especially  in the face of difficulty. Does suffering in any way mean God's separation from  man? (Romans 8:35) Give practical example.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>Even if we are passing through storms of life, we  must be convinced that God knows exactly what He is doing and that His love is  ultimately in perfect control. May this study remind us that if the worst  should happen to us, together we and God can turn it into the best.</p>

        <strong>Text: 1 John 3: 1 - 10<br />
          TOPIC: KNOWING THE ENEMY (I)<br />
      AIM: HIS COMING WILL DESTROY THE WORKS OF THE DEVIL</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Our text for today tells us that the reason why  Jesus came was to destroy the devil's work. This raises question, what sought  of work is the devil engaged in? Among many other works of the devil is calling  into question the fact of a revelation from God. God had said to Adam &ldquo;when you  eat of it you will surely die Gen.2:17. The devil appeared on the scene and  asked; 'Did God really say...? Gen 3:1. The same devil who asked that question  is still at work in the world today, calling into question the fact of a  revelation from God? Devil often comes with the question: how can you be sure that  Bible is true and is from God? The coming of Jesus will give us hope and  strength to stand firm in the face of Satan's temptation and anchor strongly on  Him in times of storms. The word of God remains our sure anchor and a weapon to  fight the devil and his agents.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1.   Why did Bible refer to Satan as the enemy? State how the works of the devil are  described in the Bible? (John 10.10, Acts 8. 18-21) <br>
          2. Name  other ways by which the enemy tempts us to destroy us today? (Philipians 3:18-19,  Matt. 4.1-11, l John 2: 15-17)<br>
          3.  How  do we question or deny the revelation of God or the authentic of word of God?  James1.8, Romans 9.20, Gal.3.1-5)<br>
          4.  The  world is becoming global village with ICT, how relevant is the word of God in  the mist of the above? (Titus 2. 11-14, 2Tim 3.14-17)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>The  fact remains that the devil is still at work in this world: to steal, kill and  destroy, but Jesus came and reveal all works of the devil. This year's Advent  will be another great opportunity to expose the works of the devil. The hope of  His coming will enable us to withstand the devil.</p>

        <strong>Text: 1 John 3: 1 - 10<br />
          TOPIC: KNOWING THE ENEMY (2)<br />
        AIM: </strong><strong>HIS COMING WILL DESTROY THE WORKS OF THE DEVIL</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Last week we explored one of the works of the  devil: calling to question the revelation from God as contains in the Holy  Scripture, the Bible. Today we will continue to uncover the other aspects of  the devils work. The fall of Adam and Eve was one of the Satan's greatest  achievements and it should not surprise us that he uses similar deception,  accusation and other strategies still. A further device of Satan which he  employed to Adam and Eve was to appeal to their physical, aesthetic and intellectual  nature of man (Gen. 3. 6.)</p>
      <p align="justify">Take first the physical, how many people are ruined  daily by pushing towards physical indulgence in area of food and drink? Second,  God created us with an appreciation for aesthetic or beautiful things around  us. But Satan pushes us to become preoccupied and indulge with it. Third God  made man with intellectual ability; unfortunately some become so brilliant in  mind that they use brilliancy to argue God out of existence.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. How  many people today are being tempted in terms of food and drinks? Is people  addiction in alcohol and smoke increasing or decreasing? (1Cor. 11.20-21, 1Cor  15: 32b, James 5.1-7, 1Cor. 10.31)<br>
          2. How do we see people's indulgence in beautiful things? Fashion is taking the  place of God in some people's heart, give suggestion on how to destroy the  enemy of mad rush for fashion. (Luk. 12.22-23, James 1. 11, 1Peter, 3.3-4)<br>
          3. Is  it possible that one may be brilliant to the extent of questioning the  existence of God, what do you think will be the cause? (Rom. 1.21-23, Jer.  5.28,<br>
          Psalm 53.1)<br>
          4. Bishop  J.C. Ryle said &ldquo;if you love your children, let the simple Bible be everything  in the training of their souls, and let other books go down and take the second  place.&rdquo; How true is this saying? Is it practical? (John 1.8, Psalm 119,105, <br>
          Prov. 22.6)</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>We are always tempted by what we eat or drink, what  we see also attract our eyes and what we desire affect our minds, In all this  God is ready to save us from indulging in them once we give Him a place in our  heart.</p>

        <strong>Text: Luke 2: 1 - 2<br />
          TOPIC: JESUS KNOWS OUR INFIRMITIES<br />
          AIM: HIS BIRTH WILL BRING JOY EVEN IN THE FACE OF INFIRMITY</strong></p>
      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Today is Christmas day. I suppose it is a day of  merriments and joy. But it baffles me to note that many who left their abodes,  took risks of the roads and came home will end up without attending church  service. Some will go as far as rebuilding the abandoned Idol shrines. It  bleeds the heart of Jesus. He must be celebrated in our lives as king of glory.  In today's study let us picture Jesus life in Nazareth in the years He was growing  up. Consider His family tree, he had a poor lineage. It was certainly nothing  to boast about. Does your family tree give you concern? Then no one understands  you better than Jesus. Perhaps you feel you have always been at a disadvantage  because you lost a parent early in life. There is a tradition that Joseph died  while Jesus was still young. The years in Nazareth would not have been easy for  Him likewise some of us now. Jesus has worn our flesh, measured its frailty and  know just how we feel.</p>
      <div align="justify"><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong>
        <p>1. Give a concise definition of what Christmas is  all about. Distinguish the doctrine of incarnation from reincarnation.? (Zech.  9.9, Isaiah 9. 2-7,John 1.1-14)<br>
          2. Why is the issue of reincarnation a serious  problem among  Christians  today 
          (Heb. 9. 27, 2 Cor 5.10, Gen. 3.19, 1 Thess.  4.13-end)<br>
          3. Christmas is a period of joy and celebration,  what will be your message to Christians that are challenged with infirmities.  (James. 1.27. 1John 4.7)<br>
          4.  In the  light of John 3.16, how do we describe the issue of giving, sharing and caring  for the poor in our church today? </p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
      </strong>Jesus Knows all our difficulties and problems. Draw  close to Him now on this Christmas Day and let Him dissolve all inclination to  feel sorry for yourself. In the presence of one who had so much against Him  accept His love today. Happy Christmas and prosperous New Year.</p>
